# Blochain concepts

## 1. Ledger

Ledger consists of two parts. Imutable history of transcations (blockchain) and world state which keeps the current state of the system. When a transaction is occured it changes the world state and that transaction is stored permenantly in the history (blockchain).

## 2. Smart Contract

Smart contract is a executable version of the bussiness contract. It contains the rules, data, processes, etc. that are used when different parties interact with the system or eachother. Once a smart contract is deployed in the blockchain, applications can invoke the smart contract using transaction.
